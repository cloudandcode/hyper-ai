# HyperAI Plugin

The HyperAI Plugin is a Node.js plugin for the [Hyper terminal](https://hyper.is/) that allows you to interact with your terminal using natural language commands. The plugin uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret your commands and execute them in your terminal.

## Installation

To install the HyperAI Plugin, you must first have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

1. Open the Hyper terminal.
2. Type `hyper install hyperai` and press enter.
3. Wait for the plugin to install.
4. Once the installation is complete, type `hyper enable hyperai` and press enter.
5. The HyperAI Plugin is now installed and enabled in your Hyper terminal.

## Usage

The HyperAI Plugin allows you to interact with your terminal using natural language commands. For example, you can say "open a new tab" or "cd to the desktop". The plugin will interpret your command and execute the corresponding action in your terminal.

Here are some examples of commands you can use:

- "open a new tab"
- "close this tab"
- "cd to the desktop"
- "create a new directory called 'test'"
- "list the files in this directory"
- "remove the file 'test.txt'"

The plugin can understand many different variations of these commands, so feel free to experiment with different ways of phrasing your commands.

## Customization

The HyperAI Plugin is highly customizable. You can customize the plugin's behavior by modifying the configuration file.

To modify the configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Open the Hyper terminal.
2. Type `hyper i hyperai` and press enter.
3. Open the `.hyper.js` file in your home directory.
4. Modify the configuration settings as desired.

The configuration file allows you to modify the plugin's language model, add custom commands, and more.

## Conclusion

The HyperAI Plugin is a powerful tool for interacting with your terminal using natural language commands. With its advanced AI capabilities and customizable configuration, you can tailor the plugin to your specific needs and preferences. Try it out and see how it can improve your workflow!
